        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Rizqi Maulana Hafidz, an Informatics Engineering graduate from
          Brawijaya University. Currently, I am actively looking for a job or
          internship, working on portfolio projects, helping with my parents'
          business, and continuously learning about technology advancements.
          During my studies, I gained knowledge in informatics such as computer
          graphics and mobile application programming, and I have experience as
          a division head in a campus community. I aspire to have a career as a
          game developer and possess strong skills in public speaking and game
          design.
